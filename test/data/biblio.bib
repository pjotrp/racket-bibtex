tems biology and genetics that have been full sequenced and deeply phenotyped. To facilitate interactive u
e of genotype-phenotype relations using many massive omics data sets for this and other segregating popula
ions, we have developed new algorithms and code that enables near-real time whole genome QTL scans  for up
to 1 million  traits. By using easily parallelizable operations including matrix multiplication, vectorize
 operations, and element-wise operations, we have decreased run-time to a few seconds for large transcript

ion of different CPU threads as well as GPUs. We found that the speed advantage of GPUs is dependent on pr

 genetic associations, but is a challenge because of privacy concerns. Here, we present a method of homomor
phic encryption that obscures individuals' genotypes and phenotypes, and is suited to quantitative genetic
association analysis. Encrypted ciphertext and unencrypted plaintext are analytically interchangeable. The
encryption uses a high-dimensional random linear orthogonal transformation key that leaves the likelihood o
f quantitative trait data unchanged under a linear model with normally distributed errors. It also preserve
s linkage disequilibrium between genetic variants and associations between variants and phenotypes. It scra
mbles relationships between individuals: encrypted genotype dosages closely resemble Gaussian deviates, and
 can be replaced by quantiles from a Gaussian with negligible effects on accuracy. Likelihood-based inferen
ces are unaffected by orthogonal encryption. These include linear mixed models to control for unequal relat
edness between individuals, heritability estimation, and including covariates when testing association. Ort
hogonal transformations can be applied in a modular fashion for multiparty federated mega-analyses where th
e parties first agree to share a common set of genotype sites and covariates prior to encryption. Each then
 privately encrypts and shares their own ciphertext, and analyses all parties' ciphertexts. In the absence
of private variants, or knowledge of the key, we show that it is infeasible to decrypt ciphertext using exi
sting brute-force or noise-reduction attacks. We present the method as a challenge to the community to dete

  abstract     = {Systems genetics combines high-throughput genomic data with genetic analysis. In this chapter, we review and discuss application of systems genetics in the context of evolutionary studies, in which high-throughput molecular technologies are being combined with quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in segregating populations.The recent explosion of high-throughput data-measuring thousands of RNAs, proteins, and metabolites, using deep sequencing, mass spectrometry, chromatin, methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation, etc.-allows the dissection of causes of genetic variation underlying quantitative phenotypes of all types. To deal with the sheer amount of data, powerful statistical tools are needed to analyze multidimensional relationships and to extract valuable information and new modes and mechanisms of changes both within and between species. In the context of evolutionary computational biology, a well-designed experiment and the right population can help dissect complex traits likely to be under selection using proven statistical methods for associating phenotypic variation with chromosomal locations.Recent evolutionary expression QTL (eQTL) studies focus on gene expression adaptations, mapping the gene expression landscape, and, tentatively, define networks of transcripts and proteins that are jointly modulated sets of eQTL networks. Here, we discuss the possibility of introducing an evolutionary "prior" in the form of gene families displaying evidence of positive selection, and using that prior in the context of an eQTL experiment for elucidating host-pathogen protein-protein interactions.Here we review one exemplar evolutionairy eQTL experiment and discuss experimental design, choice of platforms, analysis methods, scope, and interpretation of results. In brief we highlight how eQTL are defined; how they are used to assemble interacting and causally connected networks of RNAs, proteins, and metabolites; and how some QTLs can be efficiently converted to reasonably well-defined sequence variants.},

We show how any researcher can create a reusable and reproducible bioinformatics pipeline that can be deployed and run anywhere. We show how to create a scalable, reusable, and shareable workflow using four different workflow engines: the Common Workflow Language (CWL), Guix Workflow Language (GWL), Snakemake, and Nextflow. Each of which can be run in parallel.We show how to bundle a number of tools used in evolutionary biology by using Debian, GNU Guix, and Bioconda software distributions, along with the use of container systems, such as Docker, GNU Guix, and Singularity. Together these distributions represent the overall majority of software packages relevant for biology, including PAML, Muscle, MAFFT, MrBayes, and BLAST. By bundling software in lightweight containers, they can be deployed on a desktop, in the cloud, and, increasingly, on compute clusters.By bundling software through these public software distributions, and by creating reproducible and shareable pipelines using these workflow engines, not only do bioinformaticians have to spend less time reinventing the wheel but also do we get closer to the ideal of making science reproducible.

  abstract     = {Background: High-throughput whole genome sequencing facilitates investigation of minority virus sub-populations from virus positive samples. Minority variants are useful in understanding within and between host diversity, population dynamics and can potentially assist in elucidating person-person transmission pathways. Several minority variant callers have been developed to describe low frequency sub-populations from whole genome sequence data. These callers differ based on bioinformatics and statistical methods used to discriminate sequencing errors from low-frequency variants. Methods: We evaluated the diagnostic performance and concordance between published minority variant callers used in identifying minority variants from whole-genome sequence data from virus samples. We used the ART-Illumina read simulation tool to generate three artificial short-read datasets of varying coverage and error profiles from an RSV reference genome. The datasets were spiked with nucleotide variants at predetermined positions and frequencies. Variants were called using FreeBayes, LoFreq, Vardict, and VarScan2. The variant callers' agreement in identifying known variants was quantified using two measures; concordance accuracy and the inter-caller concordance. Results: The variant callers reported differences in identifying minority variants from the datasets. Concordance accuracy and inter-caller concordance were positively correlated with sample coverage. FreeBayes identified the majority of variants although it was characterised by variable sensitivity and precision in addition to a high false positive rate relative to the other minority variant callers and which varied with sample coverage. LoFreq was the most conservative caller. Conclusions: We conducted a performance and concordance evaluation of four minority variant calling tools used to identify and quantify low frequency variants. Inconsistency in the quality of sequenced samples impacts on sensitivity and accuracy of minority variant callers. Our study suggests that combining at least three tools when identifying minority variants is useful in filtering errors when calling low frequency variants.},

In this paradigm, a single bottle of 20\% (v/v) alcohol was presented as the sole liquid source for 2 or 4 h starting 3 h into the dark cycle. For 3 consecutive days mice had access to alcohol for 2 h followed by a 4th day of 4 h access and 3 intervening days where alcohol was not offered. We followed this regime for 5 weeks. For most strains, 2 or 4 h alcohol intake increased over the 5-week period, with some strains demonstrating greatly increased intake. There was considerable and heritable genetic variation in alcohol consumption upon initial early and sustained weekly exposure. Two different mapping algorithms were used to identify QTLs associated with alcohol intake and only QTLs detected by both methods were considered further. Multiple suggestive QTLs for alcohol intake on chromosomes (Chrs) 2, 6, and 12 were identified for the first 4 h exposure. Suggestive QTLs for sustained intake during later weeks were identified on Chrs 4 and 8. Thirty high priority candidate genes, including Entpd2, Per3, and Fto were nominated for early and sustained alcohol intake QTLs. In addition, a suggestive QTL on Chr 15 was detected for change in 2 h alcohol intake over the duration of the study and Adcy8 was identified as a strong candidate gene. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that early and sustained alcohol intake is likely driven by genes and pathways involved in signaling, and/or immune and metabolic function, while a combination of epigenetic factors related to alcohol experience and genetic factors likely drives progressive alcohol intake.},

We applied these approaches to multi-omics datasets from the BXD mouse genetic reference population, and identified and validated associations between genes and clinical and molecular phenotypes, including previously unreported links between Rpl26 and body weight, and Cpt1a and lipid metabolism. Furthermore, through mediation and reverse-mediation analysis we established regulatory relations between genes, such as the co-regulation of BCKDHA and BCKDHB protein levels, and identified targets of transcription factors E2F6, ZFP277, and ZKSCAN1. Our multifaceted toolkit enabled the identification of gene-gene and gene-phenotype links that are robust and that translate well across populations and species, and can be universally applied to any populations with multi-omics datasets.},

This approach requires the accumulation and integration of many types of data, and also requires the use of many types of statistical tools to extract relevant patterns of covariation and causal relations as a function of genetics, environment, stage, and treatment. In this protocol we explain how to use the GeneNetwork web service, a powerful and free online resource for systems genetics. We provide workflows and methods to navigate massive multiscalar data sets and we explain how to use an extensive systems genetics toolkit for analysis and synthesis. Finally, we provide two detailed case studies that take advantage of human and mouse cohorts to evaluate linkage between gene variants, addiction, and aging.},

  abstract     = {Genetical genomics studies uncover genome-wide genetic interactions between genes and their transcriptional regulators. High-throughput measurement of gene expression in recombinant inbred line populations has enabled investigation of the genetic architecture of variation in gene expression. This has the potential to enrich our understanding of the molecular mechanisms affected by and underlying natural variation. Moreover, it contributes to the systems biology of natural variation, as a substantial number of experiments have resulted in a valuable amount of interconnectable phenotypic, molecular and genotypic data. A number of genetical genomics studies have been published for Arabidopsis thaliana, uncovering many expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). However, these complex data are not easily accessible to the plant research community, leaving most of the valuable genetic interactions unexplored as cross-analysis of these studies is a major effort. We address this problem with AraQTL (http://www.bioinformatics.nl/Ara QTL/), an easily accessible workbench and database for comparative analysis and meta-analysis of all published Arabidopsis eQTL datasets. AraQTL provides a workbench for comparing, re-using and extending upon the results of these experiments. For example, one can easily screen a physical region for specific local eQTLs that could harbour candidate genes for phenotypic QTLs, or detect gene-by-environment interactions by comparing eQTLs under different conditions.},

  abstract     = {The gradual accumulation of genetic mutations in human adult stem cells (ASCs) during life is associated with various age-related diseases, including cancer. Extreme variation in cancer risk across tissues was recently proposed to depend on the lifetime number of ASC divisions, owing to unavoidable random mutations that arise during DNA replication. However, the rates and patterns of mutations in normal ASCs remain unknown. Here we determine genome-wide mutation patterns in ASCs of the small intestine, colon and liver of human donors with ages ranging from 3 to 87 years by sequencing clonal organoid cultures derived from primary multipotent cells. Our results show that mutations accumulate steadily over time in all of the assessed tissue types, at a rate of approximately 40 novel mutations per year, despite the large variation in cancer incidence among these tissues. Liver ASCs, however, have different mutation spectra compared to those of the colon and small intestine. Mutational signature analysis reveals that this difference can be attributed to spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosine residues in the colon and small intestine, probably reflecting their high ASC division rate. In liver, a signature with an as-yet-unknown underlying mechanism is predominant. Mutation spectra of driver genes in cancer show high similarity to the tissue-specific ASC mutation spectra, suggesting that intrinsic mutational processes in ASCs can initiate tumorigenesis. Notably, the inter-individual variation in mutation rate and spectra are low, suggesting tissue-specific activity of common mutational processes throughout life.},

To meet this need, we have developed a powerful computer program (GenEST), which links cDNA sequence data (including EST sequences) with transcript profiles revealed by cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). cDNA-AFLP is a highly reproducible differential display method based on restriction enzyme digests and selective amplification under high stringency conditions. GenEST predicts the sizes of virtual transcript derived fragments (TDFs) from cDNA sequences digested in silico. The resulting virtual TDFs could be traced back among the thousands of TDFs displayed on cDNA-AFLP gels. As a consequence, cDNA sequence databases can be screened very efficiently to identify genes with relevant expression profiles. Vice versa, using the restriction enzyme recognition sites, the primer extensions and the estimated TDF size as identifiers, the DNA sequence(s) corresponding to a TDF with an interesting expression pattern can be identified.},

  abstract     = {Genomic data analysis in evolutionary biology is becoming so computationally intensive that analysis of multiple hypotheses and scenarios takes too long on a single desktop computer. In this chapter, we discuss techniques for scaling computations through parallelization of calculations, after giving a quick overview of advanced programming techniques. Unfortunately, parallel programming is difficult and requires special software design. The alternative, especially attractive for legacy software, is to introduce poor man's parallelization by running whole programs in parallel as separate processes, using job schedulers. Such pipelines are often deployed on bioinformatics computer clusters. Recent advances in PC virtualization have made it possible to run a full computer operating system, with all of its installed software, on top of another operating system, inside a "box," or virtual machine (VM). Such a VM can flexibly be deployed on multiple computers, in a local network, e.g., on existing desktop PCs, and even in the Cloud, to create a "virtual" computer cluster. Many bioinformatics applications in evolutionary biology can be run in parallel, running processes in one or more VMs. Here, we show how a ready-made bioinformatics VM image, named BioNode, effectively creates a computing cluster, and pipeline, in a few steps. This allows researchers to scale-up computations from their desktop, using available hardware, anytime it is required. BioNode is based on Debian Linux and can run on networked PCs and in the Cloud. Over 200 bioinformatics and statistical software packages, of interest to evolutionary biology, are included, such as PAML, Muscle, MAFFT, MrBayes, and BLAST. Most of these software packages are maintained through the Debian Med project. In addition, BioNode contains convenient configuration scripts for parallelizing bioinformatics software. Where Debian Med encourages packaging free and open source bioinformatics software through one central project, BioNode encourages creating free and open source VM images, for multiple targets, through one central project. BioNode can be deployed on Windows, OSX, Linux, and in the Cloud. Next to the downloadable BioNode images, we provide tutorials online, which empower bioinformaticians to install and run BioNode in different environments, as well as information for future initiatives, on creating and building such images.},

  abstract     = {Genetical genomics combines acquired high-throughput genomic data with genetic analysis. In this chapter, we discuss the application of genetical genomics for evolutionary studies, where new high-throughput molecular technologies are combined with mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) on the genome in segregating populations.The recent explosion of high-throughput data--measuring thousands of proteins and metabolites, deep sequencing, chromatin, and methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation--allows the study of the genetic variation underlying quantitative phenotypes, together termed xQTL. At the same time, mining information is not getting easier. To deal with the sheer amount of information, powerful statistical tools are needed to analyze multidimensional relationships. In the context of evolutionary computational biology, a well-designed experiment may help dissect a complex evolutionary trait using proven statistical methods for associating phenotypical variation with genomic locations.Evolutionary expression QTL (eQTL) studies of the last years focus on gene expression adaptations, mapping the gene expression landscape, and, tentatively, eQTL networks. Here, we discuss the possibility of introducing an evolutionary prior, in the form of gene families displaying evidence of positive selection, and using that in the context of an eQTL experiment for elucidating host-pathogen protein-protein interactions. Through the example of an experimental design, we discuss the choice of xQTL platform, analysis methods, and scope of results. The resulting eQTL can be matched, resulting in putative interacting genes and their regulators. In addition, a prior may help distinguish QTL causality from reactivity, or independence of traits, by creating QTL networks.},

  abstract     = {Macrophages display flexible activation states that range between pro-inflammatory (classical activation) and anti-inflammatory (alternative activation). These macrophage polarization states contribute to a variety of organismal phenotypes such as tissue remodeling and susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases. Several macrophage- or immune-related genes have been shown to modulate infectious and inflammatory disease pathogenesis. However, the potential role that differences in macrophage activation phenotypes play in modulating differences in susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory disease is just emerging. We integrated transcriptional profiling and linkage analyses to determine the genetic basis for the differential murine macrophage response to inflammatory stimuli and to infection with the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. We show that specific transcriptional programs, defined by distinct genomic loci, modulate macrophage activation phenotypes. In addition, we show that the difference between AJ and C57BL/6J macrophages in controlling Toxoplasma growth after stimulation with interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha mapped to chromosome 3, proximal to the Guanylate binding protein (Gbp) locus that is known to modulate the murine macrophage response to Toxoplasma. Using an shRNA-knockdown strategy, we show that the transcript levels of an RNA helicase, Ddx1, regulates strain differences in the amount of nitric oxide produced by macrophage after stimulation with interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor. Our results provide a template for discovering candidate genes that modulate macrophage-mediated complex traits.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Computational biology comprises a wide range of technologies and approaches. Multiple technologies can be combined to create more powerful workflows if the individuals contributing the data or providing tools for its interpretation can find mutual understanding and consensus. Much conversation and joint investigation are required in order to identify and implement the best approaches. Traditionally, scientific conferences feature talks presenting novel technologies or insights, followed up by informal discussions during coffee breaks. In multi-institution collaborations, in order to reach agreement on implementation details or to transfer deeper insights in a technology and practical skills, a representative of one group typically visits the other. However, this does not scale well when the number of technologies or research groups is large. Conferences have responded to this issue by introducing Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF) sessions, which offer an opportunity for individuals with common interests to intensify their interaction. However, parallel BoF sessions often make it hard for participants to join multiple BoFs and find common ground between the different technologies, and BoFs are generally too short to allow time for participants to program together. RESULTS: This report summarises our experience with computational biology Codefests, Hackathons and Sprints, which are interactive developer meetings. They are structured to reduce the limitations of traditional scientific meetings described above by strengthening the interaction among peers and letting the participants determine the schedule and topics. These meetings are commonly run as loosely scheduled "unconferences" (self-organized identification of participants and topics for meetings) over at least two days, with early introductory talks to welcome and organize contributors, followed by intensive collaborative coding sessions. We summarise some prominent achievements of those meetings and describe differences in how these are organised, how their audience is addressed, and their outreach to their respective communities. CONCLUSIONS: Hackathons, Codefests and Sprints share a stimulating atmosphere that encourages participants to jointly brainstorm and tackle problems of shared interest in a self-driven proactive environment, as well as providing an opportunity for new participants to get involved in collaborative projects.},

However, various incompatibilities among database resources and analysis services make it difficult to connect and integrate these into interoperable workflows. To resolve this situation, we invited domain specialists from web service providers, client software developers, Open Bio* projects, the BioMoby project and researchers of emerging areas where a standard exchange data format is not well established, for an intensive collaboration entitled the BioHackathon 2008. The meeting was hosted by the Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS) and Computational Biology Research Center (CBRC) and was held in Tokyo from February 11th to 15th, 2008. In this report we highlight the work accomplished and the common issues arisen from this event, including the standardization of data exchange formats and services in the emerging fields of glycoinformatics, biological interaction networks, text mining, and phyloinformatics. In addition, common shared object development based on BioSQL, as well as technical challenges in large data management, asynchronous services, and security are discussed. Consequently, we improved interoperability of web services in several fields, however, further cooperation among major database centers and continued collaborative efforts between service providers and software developers are still necessary for an effective advance in bioinformatics web service technologies.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Biological data acquisition is raising new challenges, both in data analysis and handling. Not only is it proving hard to analyze the data at the rate it is generated today, but simply reading and transferring data files can be prohibitively slow due to their size. This primarily concerns logistics within and between data centers, but is also important for workstation users in the analysis phase. Common usage patterns, such as comparing and transferring files, are proving computationally expensive and are tying down shared resources. RESULTS: We present an efficient method for calculating file uniqueness for large scientific data files, that takes less computational effort than existing techniques. This method, called Probabilistic Fast File Fingerprinting (PFFF), exploits the variation present in biological data and computes file fingerprints by sampling randomly from the file instead of reading it in full. Consequently, it has a flat performance characteristic, correlated with data variation rather than file size. We demonstrate that probabilistic fingerprinting can be as reliable as existing hashing techniques, with provably negligible risk of collisions. We measure the performance of the algorithm on a number of data storage and access technologies, identifying its strengths as well as limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Probabilistic fingerprinting may significantly reduce the use of computational resources when comparing very large files. Utilisation of probabilistic fingerprinting techniques can increase the speed of common file-related workflows, both in the data center and for workbench analysis. The implementation of the algorithm is available as an open-source tool named pfff, as a command-line tool as well as a C library. The tool can be downloaded from http://biit.cs.ut.ee/pfff.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Epigenetic regulation of gene dosage by genomic imprinting of some autosomal genes facilitates normal reproductive development in both mammals and flowering plants. While many imprinted genes have been identified and intensively studied in mammals, smaller numbers have been characterized in flowering plants, mostly in Arabidopsis thaliana. Identification of additional imprinted loci in flowering plants by genome-wide screening for parent-of-origin specific uniparental expression in seed tissues will facilitate our understanding of the origins and functions of imprinted genes in flowering plants. RESULTS: cDNA-AFLP can detect allele-specific expression that is parent-of-origin dependent for expressed genes in which restriction site polymorphisms exist in the transcripts derived from each allele. Using a genome-wide cDNA-AFLP screen surveying allele-specific expression of 4500 transcript-derived fragments, we report the identification of 52 maternally expressed genes (MEGs) displaying parent-of-origin dependent expression patterns in Arabidopsis siliques containing F1 hybrid seeds (3, 4 and 5 days after pollination). We identified these MEGs by developing a bioinformatics tool (GenFrag) which can directly determine the identities of transcript-derived fragments from (i) their size and (ii) which selective nucleotides were added to the primers used to generate them. Hence, GenFrag facilitates increased throughput for genome-wide cDNA-AFLP fragment analyses. The 52 MEGs we identified were further filtered for high expression levels in the endosperm relative to the seed coat to identify the candidate genes most likely representing novel imprinted genes expressed in the endosperm of Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression in seed tissues of the three top-ranked candidate genes, ATCDC48, PDE120 and MS5-like, was confirmed by Laser-Capture Microdissection and qRT-PCR analysis. Maternal-specific expression of these genes in Arabidopsis thaliana F1 seeds was confirmed via allele-specific transcript analysis across a range of different accessions. Differentially methylated regions were identified adjacent to ATCDC48 and PDE120, which may represent candidate imprinting control regions. Finally, we demonstrate that expression levels of these three genes in vegetative tissues are MET1-dependent, while their uniparental maternal expression in the seed is not dependent on MET1. CONCLUSIONS: Using a cDNA-AFLP transcriptome profiling approach, we have identified three genes, ATCDC48, PDE120 and MS5-like which represent novel maternally expressed imprinted genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana seed. The extent of overlap between our cDNA-AFLP screen for maternally expressed imprinted genes, and other screens for imprinted and endosperm-expressed genes is discussed.},

  abstract     = {Like all plants, potato has evolved a surveillance system consisting of a large array of genes encoding for immune receptors that confer resistance to pathogens and pests. The majority of these so-called resistance or R proteins belong to the super-family that harbour a nucleotide binding and a leucine-rich-repeat domain (NB-LRR). Here, sequence information of the conserved NB domain was used to investigate the genome-wide genetic distribution of the NB-LRR resistance gene loci in potato. We analysed the sequences of 288 unique BAC clones selected using filter hybridisation screening of a BAC library of the diploid potato clone RH89-039-16 (S. tuberosum ssp. tuberosum) and a physical map of this BAC library. This resulted in the identification of 738 partial and full-length NB-LRR sequences. Based on homology of these sequences with known resistance genes, 280 and 448 sequences were classified as TIR-NB-LRR (TNL) and CC-NB-LRR (CNL) sequences, respectively. Genetic mapping revealed the presence of 15 TNL and 32 CNL loci. Thirty-six are novel, while three TNL loci and eight CNL loci are syntenic with previously identified functional resistance genes. The genetic map was complemented with 68 universal CAPS markers and 82 disease resistance trait loci described in literature, providing an excellent template for genetic studies and applied research in potato.},

  abstract     = {Esophageal gland secretions from nematodes are believed to include effectors that play important roles in plant parasitism. We have identified a novel gene family encoding secreted proteins specifically expressed in the dorsal esophageal gland of Globodera rostochiensis early in the parasitic cycle, and which contain the B30.2/SPRY domain. The secondary structure of these proteins, named the secreted SPRY domain-containing proteins (SPRYSEC), includes highly conserved regions folding into beta-strands interspersed with loops varying in sequence and in length. Mapping sequence diversity onto a three-dimensional structure model of the SPRYSEC indicated that most of the variability is in the extended loops that shape the so-called surface A in the SPRY domains. Seven of nine amino acid sites subjected to diversifying selection in the SPRYSEC are also at this surface. In both yeast-two-hybrid screening using a library from a susceptible tomato and in an in vitro pull-down assay, one of the SPRYSEC interacted with the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region of a novel coiled-coil nucleotide-binding LRR protein, which is highly similar to members of the SW5 resistance gene cluster. Given that the tomato cultivar used is susceptible to nematode infection, this SPRYSEC could be an evolutionary intermediate that binds to a classical immune receptor but does not yet, or no longer, triggers a resistance response. Alternatively, this SPRYSEC may bind to the immune receptor to downregulate its activity.},

  abstract     = {Recent genetical genomics studies have provided intimate views on gene regulatory networks. Gene expression variations between genetically different individuals have been mapped to the causal regulatory regions, termed expression quantitative trait loci. Whether the environment-induced plastic response of gene expression also shows heritable difference has not yet been studied. Here we show that differential expression induced by temperatures of 16 degrees C and 24 degrees C has a strong genetic component in Caenorhabditis elegans recombinant inbred strains derived from a cross between strains CB4856 (Hawaii) and N2 (Bristol). No less than 59\% of 308 trans-acting genes showed a significant eQTL-by-environment interaction, here termed plasticity quantitative trait loci. In contrast, only 8\% of an estimated 188 cis-acting genes showed such interaction. This indicates that heritable differences in plastic responses of gene expression are largely regulated in trans. This regulation is spread over many different regulators. However, for one group of trans-genes we found prominent evidence for a common master regulator: a transband of 66 coregulated genes appeared at 24 degrees C. Our results suggest widespread genetic variation of differential expression responses to environmental impacts and demonstrate the potential of genetical genomics for mapping the molecular determinants of phenotypic plasticity.},

  abstract     = {The release of vast quantities of DNA sequence data by large-scale genome and expressed sequence tag (EST) projects underlines the necessity for the development of efficient and inexpensive ways to link sequence databases with temporal and spatial expression profiles. Here we demonstrate the power of linking cDNA sequence data (including EST sequences) with transcript profiles revealed by cDNA-AFLP, a highly reproducible differential display method based on restriction enzyme digests and selective amplification under high stringency conditions. We have developed a computer program (GenEST) that predicts the sizes of virtual transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) of in silico-digested cDNA sequences retrieved from databases. The vast majority of the resulting virtual TDFs could be traced back among the thousands of TDFs displayed on cDNA-AFLP gels. Sequencing of the corresponding bands excised from cDNA-AFLP gels revealed no inconsistencies. As a consequence, cDNA sequence databases can be screened very efficiently to identify genes with relevant expression profiles. The other way round, it is possible to switch from cDNA-AFLP gels to sequences in the databases. Using the restriction enzyme recognition sites, the primer extensions and the estimated TDF size as identifiers, the DNA sequence(s) corresponding to a TDF with an interesting expression pattern can be identified. In this paper we show examples in both directions by analyzing the plant parasitic nematode Globodera rostochiensis. Various novel pathogenicity factors were identified by combining ESTs from the infective stage juveniles with expression profiles of approximately 4000 genes in five developmental stages produced by cDNA-AFLP.},

We address this challenge by expanding the BXD family of mice to 140 fully isogenic strains, creating a uniquely powerful model for precision medicine. This family segregates for 6 million common DNA variants-a level that exceeds many human populations. Because each member can be replicated, heritable traits can be mapped with high power and precision. Current BXD phenomes are unsurpassed in coverage and include much omics data and thousands of quantitative traits. BXDs can be extended by a single-generation cross to as many as 19,460 isogenic F1 progeny, and this extended BXD family is an effective platform for testing causal modeling and for predictive validation. BXDs are a unique core resource for the field of experimental precision medicine.},
